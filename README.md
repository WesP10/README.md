**Description:**  
A suite of AI‑augmented writing tools designed to make large language models approachable, trustworthy, and production‑ready. The portfolio spans frontend workspace design, editor ergonomics, and backend service architecture.

**Skills Used:**  
- Frontend: SvelteKit, Tiptap editor, TypeScript state management, responsive CSS architecture  
- Design: SVG icon systems, custom color pickers, accessibility‑first component design  
- Backend: Express.js API gateway, Redis caching, Supabase integration, rate limiting  
- Product Thinking: staged AI rollouts, UX writing, incremental rollout planning, observability‑first instrumentation  

**Design/Build Process:**  
1.  Ideation — mapped core AI flows (prompting, humanizing, detection, citations), audited editor ergonomics, and defined backend service responsibilities.  
2.  Modular prototyping — built panel containers, tab systems, toolbar primitives, and request/response schemas as isolated components.  
3.  Testing & iteration — validated drag‑resize UX, accessibility of color palettes, dark‑mode parity, latency assumptions, and fallback logic.  
4.  Documentation — recorded component structures, new interaction patterns, migration guidance, and living backend specifications for future contributors.
